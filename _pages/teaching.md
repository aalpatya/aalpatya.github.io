## Tutoring

I am a private tutor for Key Stage 2, GCSE, A-Levels and University admissions.
My subjects include (but are not limited to):
- Mathematics
- Further Mathematics
- Physics

I also offer university entrance guidance:
- ENGAA and PAT preparation
- Personal statements (Imperial and Oxbridge)
- Interview practice (Imperial and Oxbridge)

My aim is to instill confidence and a love for learning within my students, and my preferred method of teaching is online.
Please feel free to email me at [a.patwardhan21@imperial.ac.uk](a.patwardhan21@imperial.ac.uk) if you would like to enquire further.
