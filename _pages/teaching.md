## Tutoring

I am a private tutor for GCSE and A-Levels specialising in Maths, Further Maths and Physics.

I offer university entrance guidance (personal statements and interview practice for Imperial and Oxbridge).

My aim is to instill confidence and a love for learning within my students, and my preferred method of teaching is online.
Please feel free to email me at [a.patwardhan21@imperial.ac.uk](a.patwardhan21@imperial.ac.uk) if you would like to enquire further.
