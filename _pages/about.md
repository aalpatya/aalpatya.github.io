Welcome to my website.
I currently am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in the [Dyson Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dyson-robotics-lab/) at Imperial College London.
My [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research) is mainly in distributed multi-robot systems, as well as computer vision for robotics.

Previously I was a signal processing engineer at Cambridge Consultants, working on wireless technologies and embedded systems.

Outside of work I am a private tutor for Maths and Physics for GCSE and A-Levels, and also specialise in Oxbridge admissions tutoring and interview practice.
